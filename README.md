# iTunes Extraction

This is a silly little Javascript OSA program that can be used to extract the files of a playlist from iTunes into a specified directory. 
For example, it can be used to make an archival copy of a playlist, for backup purposes.
To use this, copy the program somewhere, make it executable, and run it:
```shell
./iTunes\ Extraction.js
```
The program guides you through the process.

Make sure you have permission to copy the files you select: I don't condone piracy.
